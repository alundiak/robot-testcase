Python within Robot Experiments
===

[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is an open source automation framework for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).

My experiments are preliminary on MacOS where I have Python v3 installed. But sometimes I experiment with Anaconda which brings me another Python executable file. And also sometimes I skip using Python environment.

## Setup Python environment for localhost

There are three ways how to do it.

Note that:
- if you frequently change approaches, you may need `Cmd+Shift+P` => `Python: Select Interpreter` + `Developer: Reload Window` to be 200% sure executable properly changed.
- On CI (GitHub Actions) Python can be used any version but behind executables `python` and `pip` and there is no need to create env there.

### `venv` (suggested)

`venv` is included in the Python Standard Library starting from Python 3.3, so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.

**Activate and Start when needed**

**Create env**:

```sh
python3 -m venv myRobotEnv
```

**Create/Activate env**:

```sh
source myRobotEnv/bin/activate
```

### `virtualenv` (kinda suggested)

`virtualenv` is an external package that you need to install via pip.

```sh
pip3 install virtualenv
```

**Create/Activate env**

```sh
virtualenv myRobotEnv
```

### `pipenv` - very optional alternative

`pipenv` combines `pip` and `virtualenv` into a single tool.

**But** it requires to `pip3 install pipenv` into **global** site-packages so that later be able to create USER located Python envs.

- `pipenv --version` => `pipenv, version 2024.0.1`
  - It creates `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
-  `pipenv install`
  - creates Virtualenv in location: `~/.local/share/virtualenvs/ttt-E***JpF`
  - To activate this project's virtualenv, run `pipenv shell`.
- Use `pipenv install` package_name which will install dependency and modify `Pipfile`.


## Install dependencies into local Python env

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

or `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` if you use `pipenv` approach (it will add/update `Pipfile`).


## Basic Robot installed in local Python environment and can be used

```bash
python3 Libraries/test_robot.py
```

## How to deactivate local Python env

- if you installed and use `venv` or `virtualenv` then to deactivate local Python environment run command: `deactivate`
- if you use `pipenv` and env was activated via `pipenv shell` then to deactivate run `exit` (yes from looks like from Terminal)


## How to make sure if local Python env is really active

**Relatively good approach**

Run

```sh
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
```

and/or:

```sh
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT
```

`$ printenv` will print many env variables including two above.

It should reflect PATH like `..../myRobotEnv`

Plus VS Code give a "hint" prefixing a folder name with name of Python env:

- `(myRobotEnv) MY_USER ~/projects_py/robot-testcase [main] $`


**Not quite OK approach**

Because even after `deactivate` below commands still refer to local Python env (even after VS Code \ `Developer: Reload Window`). Ad it is because VS Code remembers previous setting for "Python Interpreter". And even after VS Code close, and opening project in new Window, it show then still active local Virtual Python env as active.

Run

```sh
pip3 list
```

which should reflect those packages which are installed in `..../myRobotEnv/lib`

Actually even running

```sh
pip3 --version
```

will hint a PATH from where exactly it is being used:

```bash
pip 24.2 from ..../myRobotEnv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)
```

## Run Robot test files

### Variant 1 - CLI based

Considering proper Python local environment setup and dependencies installation, `robot` executable should be available:

```bash
$ robot --version
Robot Framework 7.0.1 (Python 3.12.5 on darwin)
```

Then executing this:

```bash
robot tests/test1.robot
# or if many files needed
robot tests/*.robot
```

Or if needed to run with `--otputdir` to generate results into `results` folder

```sh
robot --outputdir results tests/
```

should get this:

```text
==============================================================================
Hello World Test :: A simple Hello World test
==============================================================================
Hello World Test :: This test case prints Hello World                 | PASS |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello World Test :: A simple Hello World test                         | PASS |
1 test, 1 passed, 0 failed
==============================================================================
```

### Variant 2 - VS Code Run & Debug feature

`.vscode/launch.json` ia created to execute Robot towards current open `*.robot` file in editor.

Note, but if Python vs Python3 issue exists among using Python environment, then Robot VS Code extension seems to have bug there.


```text
Error importing robot.
Python executable: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/.vscode/extensions/robocorp.robotframework-lsp-1.12.0/src/robotframework_debug_adapter/run_robot__main__.py", line 672, in <module>
    main()
  File "~/.vscode/extensions/robocorp.robotframework-lsp-1.12.0/src/robotframework_debug_adapter/run_robot__main__.py", line 649, in main
    import robot
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'robot'
```

**Solution:**

- `Cmd+Shift+P` => `Python: Select Interpreter` => Select from local `robotEnv/bin/python3`
  - OPTIONAL might work alternative `Cmd+Shift+P` => `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` => Add/Modify `"python.pythonPath": "./robotEnv/bin/python3"`
- `Cmd+Shift+P` => `Developer: Reload Window`
- Then Open `*.robot` file in Editor, and click "Run and Debug", test should pass.

## `pylint`

If not yet installed then:

```sh
pip3 install pylint
```

```sh
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
# or
pylint Libraries/*.py
```
